# World_Population_Growth_Analysis

This repository explores the trend of world population growth using data from Kaggle:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maheshmani13/world-population-growth). The analysis reveals a steady decline in the annual growth rate, dropping from a peak of nearly 2% in the late 1960s to around 0.88% in 2023. This slowdown suggests a significant shift in population trends compared to the past.

The repository includes:

* A Jupyter Notebook in which Data cleaning, Preprocessing and EDA is performed
* Dataset file
* plot file (png)
  
Further analysis is planned to delve deeper into the implications of this slowdown for various sectors.
